From 20â€“27 September 2019, millions of people worldwide will join the young climate protesters in a global climate strike to fight for climate justice.
To support their cause, we are launching an international competition to gather state-of-the-art visualizations of climate change that were created in the last three years. 

Winners will be selected by an international jury of climate scientists, communicators, and activists. 

All submissions including info graphics, animations, and interactive visualizations that comply with the requirements will be listed on this website.
